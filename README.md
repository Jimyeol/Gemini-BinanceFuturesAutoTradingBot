### Test
~~Gemini Token's limited quantity prevents backtesting, so we're conducting live tests. This log will record entries, take-profits, and stop-losses. We're starting the test with high expectations for good profits. `This program runs every 4 hours and aims to generate profits safely.`~~
~~- _2024. 07. 19_ - **63.39 USDT** Start~~

Restarting with a focus on scalping. The previous prompt was too patient and didn't enter trades frequently enough. Replacing it with a more active scalping bot.
~~- _2024. 07. 23_ - **44.96 USDT** Start~~

#### I got liquidated. I went in aggressively, like really aggressively, with 50x leverage, and got wiped out. Donâ€™t use automated trading bots.
